##FULLSTACK DEV - CV

###Hello!

My name is Sergio and this is one of my testing repositories. In this repository you will see a hypothetic curriculum vitae (but also one that I would like to have). Here you will see:

- My experience with Coding/programming
- My understanding with coding/programming syntax
- My skills
- And also good use of both HTML and CSS.

I hope you like it and any corrections will be accepted, Thanks!  :tw-1f603:
